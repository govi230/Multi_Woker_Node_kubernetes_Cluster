# Multi Woker Node kubernetes Cluster
Visit this link to know how to use Ansible Role "kubernetes" ([Demo to SetUP Multi Node Kubernetes Cluster With the Help Of Ansible on AWS EC2 instances](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/kubernetes-multi-node-cluster-setup-aws-ansible-govind-bhardwaj))

## Overview About "kubernetes" Ansible Role  
### Operating System Platform 
This Role works on "RedHat" and "Amazon Linux 2" .
### Container Runtime Engine  
This Role right now only supports "[docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/overview/)" as Container Runtime Engine . To tell ot this Ansible Role  it give a varibale "**container_runtime_engine**".  By default this role use "docker" engine if you don't specify "container_runtime_engine" variable .
Eg-  container_runtime_engine: "docker"  
### Container Network Interface  
Right Now only "[flannel](https://github.com/coreos/flannel#flannel)" Container Network Interface is supported by this Role . "**container_netwrok_interface**" variable is available to tell this role which Container Network Interface will used to setup kubernetes cluster . By default this role use "**flannel**" network interface if you don't specify "container_runtime_engine" variable .
### Intialize Info  
This Role use "kubeadm" to intilize Kubernetes Cluster .To give Initialization Information to Role , it has "**init_info**" vaiable . This variable take multiple Arguments ( Right Now "*pod_network_cidr*" and "*ignore_preflight_errors*" are tested . )
- **apiserver_advertise_address**  ->  The IP address the API Server will advertise it's listening on. If not set the default network interface will be used.
- **apiserver_bind_port**  ->  Port for the API Server to bind to. (default 6443)
- **apiserver_cert_extra_sans**  ->  Optional extra Subject Alternative Names (SANs) to use for the API Server serving certificate. Can be both IP addresses and DNS names.
- **cert_dir**  ->  The path where to save and store the certificates. (default "/etc/kubernetes/pki")
- **certificate_key**  ->  Key used to encrypt the control-plane certificates in the kubeadm-certs Secret.
- **config**  ->  Path to a kubeadm configuration file.
- **control_plane_endpoint**  ->  Specify a stable IP address or DNS name for the control plane.
- **cri_socket**  ->  Path to the CRI socket to connect. If empty kubeadm will try to auto-detect this value; use this option only if you have more than one CRI installed or if you have non-standard CRI socket.
- **experimental_patches**  ->  Path to a directory that contains files named "target[suffix][+patchtype].extension". For example, "kube-apiserver0+merge.yaml" or just "etcd.json". "patchtype" can be one of "strategic", "merge" or "json" and they match the patch formats supported by kubectl. The default "patchtype" is "strategic". "extension" must be either "json" or "yaml". "suffix" is an optional string that can be used to determine which patches are applied first alpha-numerically.
- **feature_gates**  ->  A set of key=value pairs that describe feature gates for various features. Options are:
                                             IPv6DualStack=true|false (ALPHA - default=false)
                                             PublicKeysECDSA=true|false (ALPHA - default=false)
- **ignore_preflight_errors**  ->  A list of checks whose errors will be shown as warnings. Example: 'IsPrivilegedUser,Swap'. THi role by default will ignore "NumCPU" and "Mem" errors .
- **image_repository**  ->  Choose a container registry to pull control plane images from (default "k8s.gcr.io")
- **kubernetes_version**  ->  Choose a specific Kubernetes version for the control plane. (default "stable-1")
- **node_name**  ->  Specify the node name.
- **pod_network_cidr**  ->  Specify range of IP addresses for the pod network. If set, the control plane will automatically allocate CIDRs for every node. ( Required Parameter For this Role ) .
- **service_cidr**  ->  Use alternative range of IP address for service VIPs. (default "10.96.0.0/12")
- **service_dns_domain**  -> Use alternative domain for services, e.g. "myorg.internal". (default "cluster.local")
- **skip_phases**  ->  Don't print the key used to encrypt the control-plane certificates.
- **token**  ->  The token to use for establishing bidirectional trust between nodes and control-plane nodes. The format is [a-z0-9]{6}\.[a-z0-9]{16} - e.g. abcdef.0123456789abcdef
- **token_ttl**  ->  The duration before the token is automatically deleted (e.g. 1s, 2m, 3h). If set to '0', the token will never expire (default 24h0m0s).
- **upload_certs**  ->  Upload control-plane certificates to the kubeadm-certs Secret.

### Note
- In this Role "kubernetes" we used "kubernetes_master" and  "kubernetes_slave" inentory groups . So we created a directory "**aws**" which will help us to create a static inventory first . We created a static inventory here because if platform (Cloud , Containerisaztion etc.) changes then dynamically grouping of IP's may be changed (Means we need "kubernetes_master" grouped IP's but dynamically it is not creatin gthis group so we have to create this group .). Now if we create this directory for particular palaform then our Role will not impact .
- To create static inventory first run "**ansible_conf_setup.yml**" then run "**static_inventory.yml**" Playbooks .
- PlayBook (in my case "test-kubernetes.yml" ) which will use Ansible Role "kubernetes" we created two plays . First Play will Setup Kubenrtes Cluster ( To setup cluster for hosts we have to pass "kubernetes_cluster" , this will automatically created  when you create static inventory )and Second Play Will remove some files on Ansible Controller Node inside Role .
